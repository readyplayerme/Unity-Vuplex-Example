# Ready Player Me Unity Vuplex Example

This repository contains a Unity project that uses the paid Vuplex Web Browser plugin to run the Ready Player Me Avatar creator and load the Ready Player Me Avatar into the application at runtime. This can be used as a reference for anybody wanting to add Ready Player Me Avatars and embed the Ready Player Me avatar creator directly into their Unity application. 

# What is Vuplex?

Vuplex is actually the name of a publisher on the Unity Asset store with a number of different paid "3D WebView" plugins separated for different platforms. Note that when we say Vuplex throughout this document we are referring to their Unity Plugins. As all of their plugins are architected in a similar way the general approach and logic is quite the same for each one.  

# Project Requirements

Because the Vuplex plugins are not free we not included it in the repository. To fully run and test the project you need to have purchased one of the [Vuplex 3 WebView plugins](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/40309). If you haven't purchased one already you can use the ReadyPlayerMe discount code with [this link here](https://store.vuplex.com/cart/?coupon=ReadyPlayerMe). For any questions specifically about the Vuplex plugins please contact the developer.
